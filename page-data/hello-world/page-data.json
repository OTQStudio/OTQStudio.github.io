I’ll write about my dairy life, especially about crafting digital contents including web apps, web sites, photography, illustrations and so on.</p>\n<p>This site has three purposes: One is to gather people who are willing to join my β version projects. Second is to post informations in more detail about OTQ for people who get interested in me. Third is to develop my English writing skill.</p>\n<h2>About me</h2>\n<h3>1. My handle - OTQ</h3>\n<p>My handle in the Internet is OTQ. My real name is Yuki SHIBUYA. I usually use handle in the internet.</p>\n<h4>Why use the handle? - Why OTQ?</h4>\n<p>I think it’s hard for some people to remember person’s name. My name is Japanese name, so I don’t have confident that visitors can remember my real name. I think short and unique name is better. That’s why I use the handle.</p>\n<h3>2. My country</h3>\n<p>I was born in Kyoto of Japan. I’ll write my hometown in other article with a lot of beautiful photos.  </p>\n<h3>3. My background</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>2018-3 Graduation from Kcufs.</li>\n<li>2018-3 Start a business.</li>\n<li>2019-5 Release ULOCO.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I used to be a student in the Kobe City University for Foreign Studies.\nWhile at university, I wanted to live off someday by creating a service on my own, which services has to be well known and used all over the world.</p>\n<p>After graduation, I start a business as a web production, and sometimes work as a web designer. However I realized that I don’t have an aptitude for web designer at all. So I start to work at one warehouse two days in a week for living, and I work hard for my productions in days left.</p>\n<h2>My immediate goals</h2>\n<h3>1. To get 10 OTQ subscribers.</h3>\n<p>I wanna gather 10 OTQ subscribers at least, who are willing to join my β version projects. This is my first purpose of managing this site. I’ll explain about OTQ subscribers in other article.</p>\n<h3>2. To release a new service. (I’m developing now)</h3>\n<p>I’m developing a new service now. Releasing it is one of my immediate goals. I’m studying hard now to compensate the lack of knowledges and skills. I’m still unsure about a lot of things but I’ll do my best.</p>\n<h2>Follow me!</h2>\n<p>If you get interested in me and wanna cheer me, please follow my SNS accounts!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Facebook Page(<a href=\"https://facebook.com/otqstudio\">@OTQStudio</a>)</li>\n<li>Main Twitter:(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/otqstudio\">@OTQStudio</a> in EN)</li>\n<li>Sub Twitter: (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/uotomiz\">@uotomiz</a> in JP)</li>\n<li>(Extra) Instagram: (<a href=\"https://instagram/otqstudio\">@otq.studio</a>) ← my dairy photography</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"ULOCO Free Illustrations","date":"September 07, 2020","modified_date":"September 11, 2020","description":"This is my","category":"projects","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hello-world/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/uloco/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ULOCO Free Illustrations","category":"projects"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","3154849330"]}
